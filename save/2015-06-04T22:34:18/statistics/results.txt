Test suite, collection, and type statistics:
* 1011 tests. See [1]
* 2 test suites. See [2]
* 61 test collections. See [3]
* 12 types. See [4]
* 9 collections with two types. See [5]

Test execution statistics:

* 1011 tests in total
-------> 74 test not executed, because features not implemented in INSTANS. See [6]
-------> 552 tests failed. See [7]
       * 459 tests succeeded.

Syntax test execution statistics:

* 974 syntax tests.
      * 106 negative syntax tests.
------------>  13 negative syntax tests unexpectedly parsed! See [8]
            *  93 negative syntax tests did not parse.
      * 868 positive syntax tests.
-------------> 17 positive syntax tests did not parse! See [9]
            * 848 positive syntax tests parsed.
=============> len(positive syntax):868 > 865 = len(positive syntax not parsed):17 + len(positive syntax parsed):848! See [10]
------------------>  86 positive syntax tests parsed, but did not translate! See [11]
                  * 762 positive syntax tests parsed and translated.
------------------------>   4 positive syntax tests parsed and translated, but did not initialize! See [12]
                        * 758 positive syntax tests parsed, translated and initialized.

Query evalution test execution statistics:

* 613 query evaluation tests.
------>  77 query evaluation tests not runnable (not parsed, translated, or initialized)! See [13]
      * 536 query evaluation tests runnable (parsed, translated, initialized).
------------>  34 runnable query evaluation tests with non-implemented operations in INSTANS! See [14]
            * 502 query_runnable evaluation tests fully implemented in INSTANS.
                  * 485 query runnable evaluation tests implemented and ran.
===================> len(query runnable implemented):502 > 485 = len(query runnable implemented ran):485 + len(query runnable implemented not ran):0! See [15]
------------------------> 278 query runnable evaluation tests fully implemented in INSTANS, ran, but dit not compare! See [16]
                        * 207 query runnable evaluation tests implemented ran and compared.
                        *   4 query runnable evaluation tests implemented, ran and have different semantics. See [17]
